# `@frontend/common`

Components, utilities, and assets used by [webcert](../webcert/README.md).

- build - `pnpm --filter @frontend/common build`
- test - `pnpm --filter @frontend/common test`

## Future plans

1. Break apart shared functionality to separate packages `/packages/*`.
2. Move Webcert specific functionality/components to it's application folder `/apps/webcert`.
3. Use shared IDS components with Rehabst√∂d for new design.
